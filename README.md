# HEX2File

I built this tool for myself because I was in need for a tool to
conveniently let me preview images from hexadecimal strings.

Since the tool is using HTML's `embed` tag to render the data URI
produced, it will also generate a preview for audio files, PDFs,
videos, and even plain text.

In any case, the produced result can be saved to disk.

Feel free to contribute to your needs.
